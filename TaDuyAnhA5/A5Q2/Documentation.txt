Testing:
There are 4 steps to test the shuffling algorithm:

1. **Randomness Test:**
   The shuffle method was run multiple times and checked whether the resulting order was sufficiently random. A successful shuffle would show that cards are distributed across the deck unpredictably.

2. **Card Position Test:**
   The position of specific cards was tracked before and after shuffling. A successful shuffle would mean that cards are not maintaining their positions consistently.

3. **Equal Distribution Test:**
   Each card has an approximately equal chance of ending up in any position in the deck after shuffling. This is crucial for a fair card game.

4. **Multiple Shuffles Test:**
   The deck was iteratively shuffled multiple times to ensure that repeated shuffling still produced diverse and unbiased results.

To convince buyers: 
    The program is tested multiple times in our testing process to demonstrate its consistency and reliability. 
    A successful shuffle is defined by the algorithm producing a deck where each card has an approximately equal probability of appearing in any position. We verified this by visually inspecting shuffled decks 
    To prevent any bias or predictability, cards should not maintain their positions during shuffling. Our algorithm ensures that cards are thoroughly mixed, promoting fairness in digital card games.
    To assure non-technical stakeholders, we emphasize the Fisher-Yates algorithm's industry reputation for fairness and randomness.
